# TED Talks Recommender

### The motto of TED is "Ideas worth spreading". This Chrome extension helps spread those ideas by recommending interesting TED talks (using Machine Learning models to recommend videos based on topic tags user has clicked before) to users when their browser activity is idle for some time.
