# TED Talks Recommender
### The motto of TED is "Ideas worth spreading". This Chrome extension helps spread those ideas by recommending interesting TED talks to users when their browser activity is idle for some time.

## Logic of Recommendation:
### Using Machine Learning models(planning to use Clustering methods) to recommend videos based on the topic tags of the videos user has clicked before.
